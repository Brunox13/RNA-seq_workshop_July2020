# Closing thoughts & wrap-up

### Goals of the workshop:
- Build an appreciation of key concepts for experimental design and generation of an RNA-seq dataset for differential expression (DE)
- Develop understanding of pre-processing and QC steps for preparing a gene expression matrix for a typical RNA-seq dataset 
- Gain familiarity working with RNA-seq data at the command-line (Bash) 
- Learn the fundamentals of DE analysis and build foundational skills for performing DE in your own datasets (R/Bioconductor)

Hopefully you all feel that you have made progress toward these goals. You have downloaded the entire GitHub repo onto your local machine, so have all the materials and links to resources to continue your learning, which I encourage you to do! 

**Some final take-aways from the workshop:**
- Spend the time to plan, consult, practice, (and money) to generate high quality data that will provide robust inferences 
- If you are going to do a lot of Bioinformatics, you should get **really** good at the command-line (Bash), otherwise, pre-processing will be slow * painful
- Downstream differential expression analysis of a raw count matrix is best done in R, and requires some basic knowledge of statistics 
- Identify, understand, and check key QC metrics in the pre-processing and DE analysis portions, to ensure the quality of your results
- **PLEASE** correct for multiple testing!

Please feel free to reach out to us with questions about concepts discussed in the workshop, or for a analysis consultations. Our **bioinformatics office hours** on **Fridays 1-2pm** are a great place to do this! (currently on zoom: https://dartmouth.zoom.us/s/96998379866, pword: *bioinfo*)

### Feedback: 

We ask that you all complete the survey that has been sent out over email so that we can gauge what worked well and what we need to improve for our next workshop. If you have additional thoughts that were not addressed in the survey, please feel free to contact any one of us, or reach out to the DAC meail directly (*DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu*).

We hope to offer this workshop again, as well as workshops covering other types of genomic data analysis and bioinformatics. If you have suggestions for workshops you would like to see, please let us know! 

## Now lets discuss your questions!
