# Closing thoughts & wrap-up

**Goals of the workshop:**
- Build an appreciation of key concepts for experimental design and generation of a typical RNA-seq dataset for differential expression (DE)
- Develop understanding of pre-processing and QC steps for preparing a gene expression matrix for a typical RNA-seq dataset 
- Gain familiarity working with RNA-seq data at the command-line (Bash) 
- Learn the fundamentals of DE analysis and build foundational skills for performing DE in your own datasets (R/Bioconductor)

Hopefully you all feel that you have made progress toward these goals. You have downloaded the entire GitHub repo onto your local machine, 
so have all the materials and links to resources to continue your learning, which I encourage you to do! 

Please feel free to reach out to us with questions about concepts discussed in the workshop, or for a analysis consultations. Our bioinformatics office 
hours on Fridays 1-2pm are a great place to do this! (currently on zoom: https://dartmouth.zoom.us/s/96998379866, pword: *bioinfo*)





**Now lets discuss your questions!**
