# Closing remarks

### Workshop goals: 
- Develop a working understanding of the analytical workflow for a typical RNA-seq experiment
- Pre-process raw data in FASTQ format to generate a gene expression matrix
- Learn how to perform a detailed quality control analysis
- Develop a working understanding of the fundamental statistics behind a typical differential expression analysis using R/Bioconductor packages 
- Perform a differential expression analysis using R/Bioconductor packages 
- Learn how to explore the results and make robust insights from your data

### How to consolidate your learning: 
- Re-run the code a week or two after the workshop, as this is a great way to consolidate what you have learned at the command-line
- Edit the code, run sub-sections, read the `man` pages for commands, etc. to build a solid understanding of how everything works
- Practice pre-processing (Day-1 material) with the complete dataset (all chromosomes), that is available to you for approx. 1 month on discovery in `/dartfs-hpc/scratch/rnaseq1/data/`. This will give you experience running data from the entire genome, and an appreciation for the computational resources and required time to complete these tasks. 
- Read the methods sections of published papers that perform RNA-seq, to gain an appreciation for the range of approaches used in practice and how they are implemented 
- Read reviews like (this one)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31341269/] from Stark *et al*, 2019, *Nat. Rev. Genetics*, `RNA Sequencing: The Teenage Years`. 
- Ask us questions! (Bioinformatics office hours: https://dartmouth.zoom.us/s/96998379866, fridays at 1-2 pm. )

### I have my differentially expressed genes, what do I do now? 

**It depends!** 




- Gene ontology and pathway analysis

- Over-representation analysis (DAVID)
- Functional-class scoring (GSEA)
- Pathway topology methods (SPIA)

Link to some reading 


- Network analysis 


We plan to include functional analysis topics in future workshops from the DAC. 


### Now.... Discussion/question time!
