# Wrap-up - Day 1 

PIPING COMMANDS TOGETHER...?


### Recap: 
We have implemented the basic steps involved in *data-reduction* of an RNA-seq dataset from raw FASTQ files to a gene expression matrix. Tomorrow, we will focus on the statistical analysis of this count data to identify differentially expressed genes, and perform a basic functional enrichment analysis.

### Homework: 
- Catch-up if needed
- Edit the code and try steps with different settings 
- Bring questions of discussion points for end of day-2




### Extra exercises

1. All of your samples show good quality alignment %s except for one, which has an alignment rate of 55%?  

2. You noted when doing QC of the raw FASTQ files that this sample has many duplicated sequences.  
What might these sequences represent and how could you quickly test this?
